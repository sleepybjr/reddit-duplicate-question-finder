You are reranking Reddit search results.

User question:
{question_text}

Here are some candidate Reddit posts, each with a number, title, snippet, and URL:

{items_text}

Your job:

1. Consider ONLY posts that are clearly about the same topic as the user's question
   and that would directly help answer it.
2. Ignore posts that are off-topic, only loosely related, or mainly about something else.
3. Choose the MOST relevant posts and order them from best to worst.
4. Return at most {top_k} posts.
5. If there are fewer than {top_k} clearly relevant posts, return only those few.
   Do NOT add weak or unrelated posts just to reach {top_k}.

Return ONLY a JSON list of the numbers of the chosen posts, in best-to-worst order.
For example:
[3, 1, 5]

If only one post is clearly relevant, you might return:
[2]

Do not include any explanation or extra text, only the JSON list.
