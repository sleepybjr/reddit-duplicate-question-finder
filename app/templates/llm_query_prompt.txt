You receive a question with an optional body of additional detail, plus an optional `source` field
(e.g. a subreddit name like "sandiego").

Your job:
1. Generate ONE keyword query that is broad enough for a search engine to retrieve relevant topics, but narrow enough to avoid irrelevant noise.
2. The keyword query should be concise (4-6 words).
3. Also generate 2–4 sub-questions that break the original question into more focused parts.
4. Respond ONLY using valid JSON in this exact format:

Rules:
- The keyword query must combine the core nouns and action in a way that captures the user's intent.
- Avoid stop words, avoid super long phrases, avoid vague fillers.
- No punctuation in the keyword query unless required for meaning.
- If `source` looks like a subreddit name (e.g. "sandiego"), interpret it as a human-readable name (e.g. "San Diego") and use that form in the keyword query when it helps disambiguate location or topic.

{
  "keyword_query": "...",
  "sub_questions": ["...", "..."]
}
